;;; The saved image will be an instance of COCOA-APPLICATION (mostly
;;; so that it'll ignore its argument list.)  When it starts up, it'll
;;; run the Cocoa event loop in the cocoa event process.
;;; If you use an init file ("home:openmcl-init"), it'll be loaded
;;; in an environment in which *STANDARD-INPUT* always generates EOF
;;; and where output and error streams are directed to the OSX console
;;; (see below).  If that causes problems, you may want to suppress
;;; the loading of your init file (via an :INIT-FILE nil arg to
;;; the call to SAVE-APPLICATION, below.)

;;; As things are distributed, the file "dppccl" in the application
;;; bundle is just a placeholder.  LaunchServices may have already
;;; decided that the application isn't really executable and may
;;; have cached that fact; touching the bundle directory
;;; here is an attempt to force LaunchServices to discard that
;;; cached information.
