<chapter><title>The &CCL; IDE</title>
  
  <sect1><title>Introduction</title>
    
    <para>Clozure CL ships with the source code for a simple Cocoa
      integrated development environment that runs on Mac OS X. This
      chapter describes how to build and use that environment,
      referred to hereafter simply as "the IDE".</para>

    <para>The IDE is still in a preliminary state, and may lack many
      features you would expect to find in a polished Cocoa
      application. It does, however, provide a text editor and listener
      windows, an inspector for Lisp data structures, and a means of
      easily building a Cocoa application in Lisp. In addition, its
      source code provides an example of a fairly complex Cocoa
      application written in Lisp.</para>

    <para>A more rudimentary version of the Clozure CL IDE has been
      included for several years with the distribution. The current
      version of the IDE has seen the addition of numerous features
      and many bugfixes. Although it's by no means a finished product,
      we hope it will prove more useful than previous versions, and we
      plan additional work on the IDE for future releases.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1><title>Building the IDE</title>
    
    <para>Building the Clozure CL IDE is now a very simple
      process.</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>In a shell session, cd to the ccl directory.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Run ccl from the shell. The easiest way to do this is
          generally to execute the openmcl or openmcl64 command.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Evaluate the form <code language="lisp">(require :cocoa-application)</code></para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>For example, assuming that the &CCL; distribution is
      installed in "/usr/local/ccl", the following sequence of shell
      interactions builds the IDE:</para>

    <programlisting>
      oshirion:ccl mikel$ openmcl64
      Welcome to Clozure Common Lisp Version 1.2-r8516MS  (DarwinX8664)!
      ? (require :cocoa-application)
      ;Loading #P"ccl:cocoa-ide;fasls;cocoa-utils.dx64fsl.newest"...
      ;Loading #P"ccl:cocoa-ide;fasls;cocoa-defaults.dx64fsl.newest"...

      [...many lines of "Compiling" and "Loading" omitted...]

      Saving application to /usr/local/ccl/Clozure CL.app/

      oshirion:ccl mikel$ 

    </programlisting>

    <para>Clozure CL compiles and loads the various subsystems that
      make up the IDE, then constructs a Cocoa application bundle
      named "Clozure CL.app" and saves the Lisp image into
      it. Normally &CCL; creates the application bundle in the root
      directory of the &CCL; distribution.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1><title>Running the IDE</title>
    
    <para>After it has been built, you can run the "Clozure CL.app"
      application normally, by double-clicking its icon. When
      launched, the IDE initially displays a
      single <glossterm linkend="listener_window">listener
        window</glossterm> that you can use to interact with Lisp. You
      can type Lisp expressions for evaluation at the prompt in the
      listener window. You can also
      use <glossterm linkend="hemlock">Hemlock</glossterm> editing
      commands to edit the text of expressions in the listener
      window.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1>
    <title>IDE Features</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>Editor Windows</title>
      <para>You can open an editor window either by choosing Open from
        the File menu and then selecting a text file, or by choosing
        New from the File menu. You can also evaluate the
        expression <code>(ed)</code> in the listener window; in that
        case &CCL; creates a new window as if you had chosen New from
        the File menu.</para>

      <para>Editor windows
        implement <glossterm linkend="hemlock">Hemlock</glossterm>
        editing commands. You can use all the editing and customization
        features of Hemlock within any editor window (including listener
        windows).</para>
    </sect2>
    
    <sect2>
      <title>The Lisp Menu</title>
      <para>The Lisp menu provides several commands for interacting
        with the running Lisp session, in addition to the ways you can
        interact with it by evaluating expressions. You can evaluate a
        selected range of text in any editing buffer. You can compile
        and load the contents of editor windows (please note that in the
        current version, &CCL; compiles and loads the contents of the
        file associated with an editor window; that means that if you
        try to load or compile a window that has not been saved to a
        file, the result is an error).</para>

      <para>You can interrupt computations, trigger breaks, and select
        restarts from the Lisp menu. You can also display a backtrace or
        open the <link linkend="section_inspector_window">Inspector
          window</link>.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>The Tools Menu</title>
      <para>The tools menu provides access to the Apropos and
        Processes windows. The Apropos window searches the running Lisp
        image for symbols that match any text you enter. You can use the
        Apropos window to quickly find function names and other useful
        symbols. The Processes window lists all threads running in the
        current Lisp session. If you double-click a process entry, &CCL;
        opens an <link linkend="section_inspector_window">Inspector
          window</link> on that process.</para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>The Inspector Window</title>
      <anchor id="section_inspector_window"/>
      <para>The Inspector window displays information about a Lisp
        value. The information displayed varies from the very simple, in
        the case of a simple data value such as a character, to the
        complex, in the case of structured data such as lists or CLOS
        objects. The lefthand column of the window's display shows the
        names of the object's attributes; the righthand column shows the
        values associated with those attributes. You can inspect the
        values in the righthand column by double-clicking them.</para>

      <para>Inspecting a value in the righthand column changes the
        Inspector window to display the double-clicked object. You can
        quickly navigate the fields of structured data this way,
        inspecting objects and the objects that they refer
        to. Navigation buttons at the top left of the window enable you
        to retrace your steps, backing up to return to previously-viewed
        objects, and going forward again to objects you navigated into
        previously.</para>

      <para>You can change the contents of a structured object by
        evaluating expressions in a listener window. The refresh button
        (marked with a curved arrow) updates the display of the
        Inspector window, enabling you to quickly see the results of
        changing a data structure.</para>
    </sect2>

  </sect1>
  
  <sect1><title>IDE Sources</title>
    
    <para>&CCL; builds the IDE from sources in the "objc-bridge" and
      "cocoa-ide" directories in the &CCL; distribution. The IDE as a
      whole is a relatively complicated application, and is probably not
      the best place to look when you are first trying to understand how
      to build Cocoa applications. For that, you might benefit more from
      the examples in the "examples/cocoa/" directory. Once you are
      familiar with those examples, though, and have some experience
      building your own application features using Cocoa and the
      Objective-C bridge, you might browse through the IDE sources to
      see how it implements its features.</para>

    <para>The search path for &CCL;'s <code>REQUIRE</code> feature
      includes the "objc-bridge" and "cocoa-ide" directories. You can
      load features defined in these directories by
      using <code>REQUIRE</code>. For example, if you want to use the
      Cocoa features of &CCL; from a terminal session (or from an Emacs
      session using SLIE or ILISP), you can evaluate <code>(require
        :cocoa)</code>.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1><title>The Application Builder</title>
    
    <para>One important feature of the IDE currently has no Cocoa user
      interface: the application builder. The application builder
      constructs a
      Cocoa <glossterm linkend="application_bundle">application
        bundle</glossterm> that runs a Lisp image when double-clicked. You
      can use the application builder to create Cocoa applications in
      Lisp. These applications are exactly like Cocoa applications
      created with XCode and Objective-C, except that they are written
      in Lisp.</para>

    <para>To make the application builder available, evaluate the
      expression <code>(require :build-application)</code>. &CCL; loads
      the required subsystems, if necessary.</para>

    <para>
      <command><varname>BUILD-APPLICATION</varname> <varname>&key;</varname>
        (<parameter>name</parameter> <replaceable>"MyApplication"</replaceable>)
        (<parameter>type-string</parameter> <replaceable>"APPL"</replaceable>)
        (<parameter>creator-string</parameter> <replaceable>"OMCL"</replaceable>)
        (<parameter>directory</parameter> <replaceable>(current-directory)</replaceable>)
        (<parameter>nibfiles</parameter> <replaceable>NIL</replaceable>)
        (<parameter>main-nib-name</parameter> <replaceable>NIL</replaceable>)
        (<parameter>application-class</parameter> <replaceable>'GUI::COCOA-APPLICATION</replaceable>)
        (<parameter>toplevel-function</parameter> <replaceable>NIL</replaceable>)
        [Function]</command>
    </para>

    <para>
      The <varname>build-application</varname> function constructs an
      application bundle, populates it with the files needed to satisfy
      Mac OS X that the bundle is a launchable application, and saves an
      executable Lisp image to the proper subdirectory of the
      bundle. Assuming that the saved Lisp image contains correct code,
      a user can subsequently launch the resulting Cocoa application by
      double-clicking its icon in the Finder, and the saved Lisp
      environment runs.
    </para>

    <para>The keyword arguments control various aspects of application
      bundle as <code>BUILD-APPLICATION</code> builds it.</para>
    <variablelist>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><varname>name</varname></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Specifies the application name of the
            bundle. <code>BUILD-APPLICATION</code> creates an application
            bundle whose name is given by this parameter, with the
            extension ".app" appended. For example, using the default
            value for this parameter results in a bundle named
            "MyApplication.app".</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><varname>type-string</varname></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Specifies type of bundle to create. You should normally
            never need to change the default value, which Mac OS X uses to
            identify application bundles.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><varname>creator-string</varname></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Specifies the <glossterm linkend="creator_code">creator
              code</glossterm>, which uniquely identifies the application
            under Mac OS X. The default creator code is that of &CCL;. For
            more information about reserving and assigning creator codes,
            see
            Apple's <ulink url="http://developer.apple.com/datatype/index.html">developer
              page</ulink> on the topic.</para>

      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><varname>directory</varname></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The directory in which <code>BUILD-APPLICATION</code>
            creates the application bundle. By default, it creates the
            bundle in the current working directory. Unless you
            use <code>CURRENT-DIRECTORY</code> to set the working
            directory, the bundle may be created in some unexpected place,
            so it's safest to specify a full pathname for this argument. A
            typical value might be <code>"/Users/foo/Desktop/"</code>
            (assuming, of course, that your username is "foo").</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><varname>nibfiles</varname></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>A list of pathnames, where each pathname identifies
            a <glossterm linkend="nibfile">nibfile</glossterm> created
            with
            Apple's <glossterm linkend="InterfaceBuilder">InterfaceBuilder</glossterm>
            application. <code>BUILD-APPLICATION</code> copies each
            nibfile into the appropriate place in the application bundle,
            enabling the application to load user-interface elements from
            them as-needed. It is safest to provide full pathnames to the
            nibfiles in the list. Each nibfile must be in ".nib" format,
            not ".xib" format, in order that the application can load
            it.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><varname>main-nib-name</varname></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The name of
            the <glossterm linkend="nibfile">nibfile</glossterm> to load
            initially when launching. The user-interface defined in this
            nibfile becomes the application's main interface. You must
            supply the name of a suitable nibfile for this parameter, or
            the resulting application uses the &CCL; user
            interface.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><varname>application-class</varname></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The name of the application's CLOS class. The defaut
            value is the class provided by &CCL; for graphical
            applications. Supply the name of your application class if you
            implement one. If not, &CCL; uses the default class.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><varname>toplevel-function</varname></term>
        <listitem>
          <para>The toplevel function that runs when the application
            launches. Normally the default value, which is &CCL;'s
            toplevel, works well, but in some cases you may wish to
            customize the behavior of the application's toplevel. The best
            source of information about writing your own toplevel is the
            &CCL; source code, especially the implementations
            of <code>TOPLEVEL-FUNCTION</code> in
            "ccl/level-1/l1-application.lisp"</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

    </variablelist>

    <para>Please note that <code>BUILD-APPLICATION</code> is a work in
    progress. It can easily build a working Cocoa application, but it
    still has limitations that may in some cases prove
    inconvenient. For example, in the current version it provides no
    easy way to specify an application delegate different from the
    default. If you find the current limitations
    of <code>BUILD-APPLICATION</code> too restrictive, and want to rty
    extending it for your use, you can find the source code for it
    in "ccl/cocoa-ide/build-application.lisp".</para>

    <para>For more information on how to
    use <code>BUILD-APPLICATION</code>, see the Currency Converter
    example in "ccl/examples/cocoa/currency-converter/".</para>
