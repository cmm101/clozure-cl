<chapter><title>Using &CCL;</title>
  
  <sect1><title>Introduction</title>
    
    <para>The Common Lisp standard allows considerable latitude in the
      details of an implementation, and each particular Common Lisp
      system has some idiosyncracies. This chapter describes ordinary
      user-level features of &CCL;, including features that may be
      part of the Common Lisp standard, but which may have quirks or
      details in the &CCL; implementation that are not described by
      the standard.</para>
