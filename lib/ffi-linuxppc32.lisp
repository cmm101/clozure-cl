;;; LinuxPPC32:
;;; Structures are never actually passed by value; the caller
;;; instead passes a pointer to the structure or a copy of it.
;;; Structures whose size is 8 bytes or less are returned in r3/r4;
;;; this happens rarely enough that we can probably get away with
;;; boxing an :UNSIGNED-DOUBLEWORD and storing it in the structure-return
;;; argument.
