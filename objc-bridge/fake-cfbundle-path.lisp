;;; Before loading any Cocoa code which depends on CFBundle/NSBundle
;;; being able to find an application bundle, it -may- be neccessary
;;; to point the environment variable "CFProcessPath" to some file
;;; that's where the bundle's executable would be.
;;; This should only be necessary if the current application isn't
;;; already "inside a bundle".  If it is necessary, it has to happen
;;; before the CoreFoundation library's initialized.
