;;; The "CCL" logical host won't have its translations set correctly
;;; (fixing this is left as an exercise), so REQUIRE and other things
;;; that depend on those logical pathname translations won't work right.
;;; If things go wrong, you might see some debugging information via
;;; the OSX console (/Applications/Utilities/Console.app.)  Standard
;;; and error output for the initial lisp process will be directed
;;; there.
