      <h2>Adjust the Window's Appearance.</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      <p>Now that we've created an InterfaceBuilder project, let's
      adjust the appearance of our application's UI. We'll start by
      setting the size of the main window. Make sure the "Window"
      object is selected in InterfaceBuilder's project window, as
      before:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="inline-image">
      <img src="../images/ibwindow1.jpg" 
           border='0'/>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      <p>With the "Window" object selected, change the display in the
      Inspector window from the "Attributes" to "Window Size":</p>
    </div>

    <div class="inline-image">
      <img src="../images/ibwindow3.jpg" 
           border='0'/>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      <p>The "Window Size" inspector has four sections of
      options. Find the third section, "Content Size &amp; Position", near the bottom of the
      Inspector window, and type in the width and height for the
      window. Use 400 as the width, and 200 as the height. You can
      also adjust the initial position of the window if you like,
      using the draggable widget in the "Initial Position"
      section.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-head">
      <h2>Add UI Elements</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      <p>The user interface for the Currency Converter application
      uses three text fields and a button to provide currency
      conversions. To add these elements to the main window, we'll
      find them in InterfaceBuilder's "Library" window and drag them
      to the main window. When you drop a Library object on an
      application window, InterfaceBuilder creates an instance of
      that object and adds it to your application.</p>

      <p>First, make sure the "Library" window is open. If it isn't,
      you can open it by choosing the "Library" item from
      InterfaceBuilder's "Tools" menu.</p>

      <p>The "Library" window provides a hierarchical browser that you
      can use to find Library objects to add to your applications. The
      browser uses an outline view to show the available Library
      objects. Click disclosure triangles to the left of Library
      container icons to show or hide the available objects.</p>

      <p>As an example, here is the Library browser's appearance when
      the Library container is closed:</p>
      
    <div class="inline-image">
      <img src="../images/ibwindow4.jpg" 
           border='0'/>
    </div>

      <p>...and here it is with the Library container open:</p>
      
    <div class="inline-image">
      <img src="../images/ibwindow5.jpg" 
           border='0'/>
    </div>

    <div class="nav">
      <p><a href="building_ui.html">previous</a> | <a href="../../HOWTO.html">start</a> | <a href="building_ui3.html">next</a></p>
    </div>
