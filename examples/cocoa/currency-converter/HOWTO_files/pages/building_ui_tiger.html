      <h1>Building the User Interface on "Tiger"</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      <p>If you are using Mac OS X 10.4.x ("Tiger") to build your
      application, then the Apple tutorial's section on building the
      UI may be somewhat confusing. Apple's tutorial uses
      InterfaceBuilder 3.x to show how to build an interface, and
      there were many interface changes between versions 2.x and 3.x
      of InterfaceBuilder. In this section we see how to build the UI
      using InterfaceBuilder 2.x.</p>

      <div class="section-head">
        <h2>Launch InterfaceBuilder</h2>
      </div>

      <p>Start by locating Apple's InterfaceBuilder application. If
        you installed Apple's Developer Tools, InterfaceBuilder should
        be in the folder "/Developer/Applications/":</p>

      <div class="inline-image">
        <img src="../images/finder-win2.jpg"alt="" 
             border='0'/>
      </div>
    
      <p class= "note"><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> If you have not
        installed Apple's Developer Tools, you should do that now. You
        will not be able to build the CurrencyConverter example
        without them. The Developer Tools are distributed as an
        optional install with Mac OS X 10.4 ("Tiger"). Look for the
        "XCode Tools" package in the "Optional Installs" folder on the
        Mac OS 10.4 install disk.</p>

      <p>Once you have located InterfaceBuilder, double-click to launch
        the application. InterfaceBuilder presents a window you can use
        to choose a template for the nibfile you are going to create.</p>

      <div class="inline-image">
        <img src="../images/ibwin-tiger1.jpg"alt="" 
             border='0'/>
      </div>

      <p>Make sure the "Application" option is selected in the "Cocoa"
      section and click the "New" button to create a new
      nibfile. InterfaceBuilder creates a new application nibfile, but
      doesn't immediately save it. The Objective C objects that
      represent the new application's interface appear in a new
      untitled window:</p>

      <div class="inline-image">
        <img src="../images/ibwin-tiger2.jpg"alt="" 
             border='0'/>
      </div>

      <p>The intial window and menubar also appear on the screen. The
      new application's name appears in the menus as
      "NewApplication". Save the new nibfile into the
      "currency-converter" folder that you created earlier
      (on <a href="making_project.html">this page</a>).</p>
