      <p>The next step in creating a Lisp version of the currency
      converter application is to construct the user
      interface. Apple's
      tutorial <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCTutorial/chapter03/chapter_3_section_1.html">
      describes in detail</a> how to do this.</p>

<p>Apple's tutorial explains how to use InterfaceBuilder to create the
  user interface, and how to use XCode to create project files and
  write Objective-C code. Our project uses Lisp instead of
  Objective-C, and does not use XCode project files, so you can skip
  the part of the tutorial that explains how to use XCode.</p>

<p>Begin by launching InterfaceBuilder, which you will find in the
  "/Developer/Applications/" folder. Create a new nibfile by using
  InterfaceBuilder's "Starting Point" dialog. If the "Starting Point"
  dialog doesn't appear when you launch InterfaceBuilder, you can
  display it by choosing "New" from the File menu. Choose "Cocoa
  Application", and click the "New" button to create the
  nibfile.</p>

           border='0'/>
    </div>


<p>Save the nibfile in your "currency-converter" folder. Name it
  "CurrencyConverter.nib". Apple's tutorial names it "MainMenu.nib",
  but we won't use that name. When building an application with
  OpenMCL, we gradually change the behavior of the OpenMCL application
  until it behaves the way we want for our application. OpenMCL's IDE
  already has a nibfile built into it with the name "MainMenu.nib",
  and if we wanted to use that name for the CurrencyConverter
  application, we would have to replace OpenMCL's "MainMenu.nib". It's
  generally a good idea to avoid destroying or replacing things unless
  you really have to, so, in order to preserve the OpenMCL nibfile,
  give yours the name "CurrencyConverter.nib".</p>

<p>Now you can use this nibfile to create your application's user
  interface. When Apple's tutorial tells you to find and open the main
  nibfile created by XCode, use your "CurrencyConverter.nib"
  instead.</p>

<p>Skip straight to the part of Apple's tutorial
called <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCTutorial/chapter03/chapter_3_section_3.html">Creating
the Currency Converter Interface</a>. Read the introduction to
nibfiles, and follow the instructions to create the Currency Converter
interface. (Remember that when the tutorial tells you to open and edit
"MainMenu.nib", you will instead open and edit your
"CurrencyConverter.nib".) When you reach the end of the section
called <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCTutorial/chapter03/chapter_3_section_6.html">Defining
the Converter Class</a>, you are done creating the interface for your
application. Save your nibfile and continue with the next section of
this HOWTO, on writing the Lisp code that provides the application's
behavior.</p>
