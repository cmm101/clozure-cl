      <h1>Building the User Interface</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      <p>This section describes how to use Apple's InterfaceBuilder
      application to build the main window and menu of the
      CurrencyConverter application. Apple's
      tutorial <a
      href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCTutorial/chapter03/chapter_3_section_1.html">
          describes in
      detail</a> how to do this; this section is a much briefer
      description of the steps.</p>
      
      <p>One detail worth noting is that Apple's example was written
      for use with the version of InterfaceBuilder shipped with Mac
      OS X Tiger (10.4). This HOWTO describes OpenMCL features that
      are available only on Mac OS X Leopard (10.5). The main
      purpose, then, of this section, is to describe how to build the
      user interface using the Leopard version of InterfaceBuilder,
      which differs in some details from the Tiger version.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-head">
      <h2>Create a Nibfile</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      <p>Begin by starting up InterfaceBuilder, which you can find in
      the "/Developer/Applications/" directory:</p>
    </div>

    <div class="inline-image">
      <img src="../images/IB.jpg" 
           border='0'/>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      <p>InterfaceBuilder starts by asking you to choose a type of
      project. Make sure the tab at the top of the view has the
      option "Cocoa" selected, then click the "Application" icon,
      then click the "Choose" button at the bottom right.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="inline-image">
      <img src="../images/choose_proj.jpg" 
           border='0'/>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      <p>InterfaceBuilder creates a new application project,
      including an empty document window and a new main menubar. It
      automatically names the new application "NewApplication"; you
      can see this name in the main menubar.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="inline-image">
      <img src="../images/mmenu.jpg" 
           border='0'/>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      <p>Double-click the name "NewApplication" in the main menubar
      and change it to read "CurrencyConverter". After the new name is
      accepted, look through the individual menus to find other
      references to "NewApplication", and change them the same way. In
      the application menu you'll find items named "About
      NewApplication", "Hide NewApplication", and "Quit
      NewApplication". The "Help" menu contains an item entitled
      "NewApplication Help". Change all of these, replacing
      "NewApplication" with "CurrencyConverter". Then choose a place
      to save the project. Make sure it's someplace convenient;
      you'll want to find it later so that you can load it with your
      Lisp code.</p>

      <p>Now we'll begin modifying the empty window to turn it into
      the main user interface of our CurrencyConverter
      application. Begin by finding the "Window" icon in the
      InterfaceBuilder CurrencyConverter window:</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="inline-image">
      <img src="../images/ibwindow1.jpg" 
           border='0'/>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      <p>With the "Window" icon selected, choose the "Attributes"
      icon in the Inspector window. If the Inspector window is not
      open, you can open it by choosing "Inspector" from the "Tools"
      menu. The "attributes" button is the one farthest to the left
      at the top of the Inspector window.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="inline-image">
      <img src="../images/ibwindow2.jpg" 
           border='0'/>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      <p>Now change the attributes of the "Window" object to match
      the requirements of the CurrencyConverter interface. Make sure
      the "Textured" box is checked. Also make sure the "Visible At Launch" box is
      checked, and the menu at the bottom, among the "Memory"
      options, shows "Buffered".</p>

      <p>Next, change the text in the "Title" box at the top of the
      Inspector window to read "Currency Converter", instead of "Window".</p>
