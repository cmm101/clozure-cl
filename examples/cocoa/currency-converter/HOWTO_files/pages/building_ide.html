      <h1>Building the OpenMCL IDE</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="body-text">
      <p>OpenMCL comes with a Cocoa application called "OpenMCL.app",
      which provides a graphical IDE for editing, compiling, and
      running Lisp code. The IDE is a work in progress, and may not
      yet provide everything you need to be comfortable developing
      Lisp applications. It is sufficient for developing the
      CurrencyConverter example application, though, and this HOWTO
      assumes that you wll use it.</p>

      <p>The IDE is distributed in source form with OpenMCL, and you
      need to build it before you can use it. Fortunately, building
      the IDE is very easy.</p>

      <p>First, make sure you have a recent version of OpenMCL, and
      that it is installed correctly. You can obtain OpenMCL from
      <a href="http://openmcl.clozure.com/">Clozure's OpenMCL
      page</a>. The <a href="http://openmcl.clozure.com/TmpCVS/index.html">CVS
      access page</a> explains how to get more recent development
      versions, and
      the <a href="http://openmcl.clozure.com/Doc/index.html#Installation">documentation
      page on installation</a> explains how to install it
      correctly.</p>

      <p>Once you have a working OpenMCL, you should be able to open
      a Terminal window and run the command "openmcl" to obtain a
      running OpenMCL session:</p>
      
      <div class="subtitle">
        <img src="../images/term1.jpg"alt="" 
             border='0'/>
      </div>

      <p>Now, assuming OpenMCL is installed correctly, you can build
      the IDE by typing:</p>

      <p><code>(require "COCOA-APPLICATION")</code></p>

      <p>OpenMCL compiles and loads the source files needed to build
      the IDE, then writes the executable to the path:</p>

      <p>ccl/cocoa-ide/OpenMCL.app</p>

      <p>OpenMCL then quits (because the implementation of
      SAVE-APPLICATION, which writes the executable, causes OpenMCL to
      quit).</p>

      <p>You should now be able to start the IDE by double-clicking
      the application in ccl/cocoa-ide/OpenMCL.app. Please note that
      this Cocoa application bundle exists in the OpenMCL distribution
      as it comes from Clozure, but it won't work until you follow
      these instructions to build the IDE. The bundle as it comes from
      Clozure is doesn't have the necessary executable in it until you
      build it.</p>

      <p>You should now be ready to continue with the HOWTO, using
      OpenMCL.app to create and edit Lisp files.</p>
