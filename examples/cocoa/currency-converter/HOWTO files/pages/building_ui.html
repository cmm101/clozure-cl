    <div class="body-text">
      <p>This section describes how to use Apple's InterfaceBuilder
      application to build the main window and menu of the
      CurrencyConverter application. Apple's
      tutorial <a
      href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCTutorial/chapter03/chapter_3_section_1.html">
          describes in
      detail</a> how to do this; this section is a much briefer
      description of the steps.</p>
      
      <p>One detail worth noting is that Apple's example was written
      for use with the version of InterfaceBuilder shipped with Mac
      OS X Tiger (10.4). This HOWTO describes OpenMCL features that
      are available only on Mac OS X Leopard (10.5). The main
      purpose, then, of this section, is to describe how to build the
      user interface using the Leopard version of InterfaceBuilder,
      which differs in some details from the Tiger version.</p>

      <p>Begin by starting up InterfaceBuilder, which you can find in
      the "/Developer/Applications/" directory:</p>

    <div class="body-text">
      <p>InterfaceBuilder starts by asking you to choose a type of
      project. Make sure the tab at the top of the view has the
      option "Cocoa" selected, then click the "Application" icon,
      then click the "Choose" button at the bottom right.</p>
