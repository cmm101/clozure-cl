      <p>This HOWTO guide explains how to use OpenMCL to create a
      Cocoa application that is functionally identical to Apple's
      <a
      href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCTutorial/chapter01/chapter_1_section_1.html">
        Currency Converter</a> example. The most important
        difference between Apple's example and this one is that this
        one is implemented in Common Lisp instead of Objective C. It
        uses OpenMCL's Objective-C bridge to provide communication
        between the Lisp code that you write and Apple's Cocoa
        frameworks. The resulting application looks and acts just
        like any other Cocoa application.</p>

      <p>This HOWTO doesn't discuss all the background information
      that Apple's tutorial covers. Instead, we assume that you have
      Apple's document handy for reference, and we just describe the
      specific steps needed to build the example using
      Apple's InterfaceBuilder application and OpenMCL.</p>

      <p>The current version of the OpenMCL Objective-C bridge
      includes code that was formerly distributed separately as the
      "Bosco" application framework. Because that framework has been
      integrated with OpenMCL proper, it no longer exists as a
      separate project. "Bosco" now names only the decorative rodent
      at the top of this page.</p>

      <h2>Apple's Currency Converter Example</h2>

    <div class="body-text">
      <p>It will be helpful in understanding this example if you can
      easily refer to Apple's <a
      href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCTutorial/chapter01/chapter_1_section_1.html">
        Currency Converter</a> example while working through this
      HOWTO. You might consider opening a separate window or tab, and
      keeping the Apple example handy while you work.</p>

      <p>In some ways, the Lisp version of the example is simpler
      than the Objective C example, but the basic concepts are the
      same. In particular, the Lisp example follows the same
      <a
      href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ObjCTutorial/chapter02/chapter_2_section_3.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20002050-TPXREF104">
        Model-View-Controller</a> paradigm that the Apple example
        uses. If you are new to Cocoa programming, or if you are not
        familiar with how it uses the Model-View-Controller paradigm,
        it's probably a good idea to read through the Apple example
        in full, paying special attention to the
        Model-View-Controller section. Once you've done that, keep
        the Apple pages handy in a window for easy reference.</p>

      <p>This Common Lisp version of the Currency Converter example
      uses Apple's InterfaceBuilder application to build a window and
      main menu, and then uses Common Lisp code to load and operate
      that user interface. The Common Lisp code relies on OpenMCL's
      Objective-C bridge to provide communication between the running
      Lisp code and Apple's Cocoa frameworks. Once the code is
      complete, we use the BUILD-APPLICATION function to save a
      working Cocoa application bundle. That bundle looks and acts
      just like any other Cocoa application.</p>
